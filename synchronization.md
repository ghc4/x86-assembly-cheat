# Synchronization

TODO understand better and make multithreaded examples that fail.

TODO Other sync instructions:

- MFENCE
- LFENCE
- SFENCE

Likely should be done with inline assembly. TODO: is it possible to test those things here (see failures) e.g. under the Linux kernel, or do we need to go bare metal?
