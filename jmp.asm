; The jmp address has the following forms. Quoting Intel manual:
;
; > - Near jump - A jump to an instruction within the current code segment
; > (the segment currently pointed to by the CS register),
; > sometimes referred to as an intrasegment jump.
; >
; > - Short jump - A near jump where the jump range is limited to
; > â€“128 to +127 from the current EIP value.
; >
; > - Far jump - A jump to an instruction located in a different segment
; > than the current code segment but at the same privilege level,
; > sometimes referred to as an intersegment jump.
; >
; > - Task switch - A jump to an instruction located in a different task.

; Short jump example:

;
; TODO:
;
; - only near jump and short jump are possible in userland.
; - NASM automatically decides between near and short, you cannot explicitly choose
; - task switch jump example
